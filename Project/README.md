+ A chat app between client and server suitable for a charity like childline/samaritans
+ I made a design decision not to set the username for the app in the settings and decided to request authentication on each launch because of the private nature of my app.  I wanted the user to login with their username and password to ensure the confidentiality of the data even if the phone was stolen or used by anyone else.

The chat app was based on https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-ioschat/
However it was developed on Xcode 3 so I had to make some changes

I implemented http://alexbarinov.github.io/UIBubbleTableView/ for my chat bubbles
