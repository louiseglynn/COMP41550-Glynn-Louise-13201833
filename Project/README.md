+ A chat app between client and server only with data storage
+ Based on https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-ioschat/
However it was developed on Xcode 3 so I had to make some changes

I made a design decision not to set the username for the app and request authentication because of the private nature of my app.  I wanted the user to login with their username and password to ensure the confidentiality of the data even if the phone was stolen or used by anyone else.

I used http://mobiforge.com/design-development/sms-bubble-ui-iphone-apps for the customisation of my table view cells so that they contained speech bubbles
